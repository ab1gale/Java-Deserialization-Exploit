# Java Deserialization Exploit

A proof-of-concept tool which weaponizes frohoff's original ysoserial code to gain a remote shell.

## Description

This tool builds upon the proof-of-concept ysoserial by Chris Frohoff (https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) and exploits
the vulnerability, using Metasploit Framework tools to generate a malicious binary and an embedded web server to transfer
the payload to the victim. A slightly modified version of ysoserial is used to download and execute the binary on the
victim's side.

__Note:__ This tool is still in an early stage of development, and many features have not yet been implemented. Only the
JBoss platform is currently exploitable.
